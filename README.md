#Introduction

A data analysis was conducted to assess how many Kickstarter campaigns succeeded and failed, and what criteria impacted their success.

#Data and Model

We have looked percentage successful and failed ranging from a goal of $1,000 to $50,000.  The most successful campaigns had goals less than $1,500.  There was a peak in successful campaigns in May which decreases over time.  THe failed rate is highest in in December, and improves in July.  

#Conclusion

Based on the findings there are three reasonable conclusions
1. Louise should limit her goal to less than $1,500
2. The best time to laaunch the campaign would be in April, and should end no later than July.
3.  The category of plays is a successful category.

#Limitations

This data does not include demographic information about backers.  If the data included demographic information, we would be able to determine which groups of people the campaign should target.

#suggestions

Add a section to this report analyzing the length of time for failed, successful and live campaigns.
Add a section to this report analyzing demographics of backers, if this information can be obtained.
Add a section to the summary which includes categories to visually display the fact that plays are a successful category.
